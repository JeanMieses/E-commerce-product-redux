## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS module
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Splide](https://splidejs.com/) -lightweight, flexible and accessible slider/carousel 

### What I learned

I learned how to use Redux Toolkit to handle the App Wide States by creating reducers (functions) to
handler functionalities such as adding an item to the cart or removing it.


### Useful resources

- [Splide Docs](https://splidejs.com/documents/) - This helped me a lot in understanding how to work with Splide carousel.
